# DecentralizedChat

A completely decentralized, peer-to-peer chat system.


---

# Build and Run

There is a pre-built JAR file `DecentralizedChat.jar` so no need to build the project.
You need at least Java 8 to run these JARs.

### Running the app

Since the system is entirely P2P, you can run as many peers as you want and have them connect
to each other using groups.

```shell
java -jar DecentralizedChat.jar
```

The events and activities happening on the server can be observed in the log files which are
saved on a per-user basis in the directory `app_data`.
